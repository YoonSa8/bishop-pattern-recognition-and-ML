🧠 Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning — Notes (Bishop, 2006)
Welcome! This repository contains my personal notes from studying the book
"Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Christopher M. Bishop (2006) — a foundational and rigorous text in the field of machine learning.

I completed this book over a period of 4 months, taking detailed notes chapter by chapter. These notes cover both the theoretical concepts and key mathematical derivations presented in the book.

📚 Why This Repo?
This repo is aimed at:

Learners looking for structured notes while reading Bishop’s book

Anyone who wants a refresher on the core mathematical concepts behind ML

People who like seeing theory broken down into digestible pieces
